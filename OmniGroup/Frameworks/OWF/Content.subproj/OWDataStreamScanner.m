// NB: Arguably, some of this functionality should be in the superclass. The superclass' definition could call _rewindCharacterSource and most of this method's functionality could be moved into an overridden version of that one. However, _rewindCharacterSource's semantics would have to be thought out a little more, since right now it's also used for actual seeks (which always fail). The tricky part would be making sure that an unseekable dataStream raises an exception early enough that the scanner is left in a consistent state.
