Messages to this group received on other interfaces will not be delivered to the socket.  Valid addresses are those between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255.

- (void)setShouldLoopMessagesToMemberGroups:(BOOL)shouldLoop;
    // If a message is set to a group to which the sending host itself belongs, by default a coup of the datagram is looped back by the IP layer for local delivery.  This allows this looping behaviour to be configured.
    //
    // A multicast datagram sent with an initial TTL greater than 1 may be delivered to the sending host on a different interface from that on which it was sent, if the host belongs to the destination group on that other interface.  The loopback control option has no effect on such delivery.
