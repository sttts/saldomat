/*
 This attempts to fine the effective MTU between a client and server by empirical observation.
 This test is written to use IP multicast (so you could run multiple clients against a single
 server), but it could be modified to use vanilla UDP.

 This test reports the MTU for the payload data, and doesn't include the number of bytes
 used by any of the network layers in each packet.
