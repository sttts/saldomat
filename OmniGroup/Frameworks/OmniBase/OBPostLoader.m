/*"
OBPostLoader provides the functionality that you might expect to get from implementing a +load method.  Unfortunately, some implementations of OpenStep have bugs with their implementation of +load.  Rather than attempt to use +load, OBPostLoader provides similar functionality that actually works.  Early in your program startup, you should call +processClasses.  This will go through the ObjC runtime and invoke all of the +performPosing and +didLoad methods.  Each class may have multiple implementations of each of theses selectors -- all will be called.

OBPostLoader listens for bundle loaded notifications and will automatically reinvoke +processClasses to perform any newly loaded methods.

OBPostLoader also listens for NSBecomingMultiThreaded and will invoke every implementation of +becomingMultiThreaded.

In this case we'd end up 'locking' nil when starting the +didLoad processing and then unlocking a non-nil lock that we didn't own.  We could create the lock in +_becomingMultiThreaded: _and_ lock it if we are in the middle of +processSelector:initialize:, but that's just getting too complicated.

Searches the ObjC runtime for particular methods and invokes them.  Each implementation will be invoked exactly once.  Currently, there is no guarantee on the order that these messages will occur.  This should be called as the first line of main().  Once this has been called at the beginning of main, it will automatically be called each time a bundle is loaded (view the NSBundle loading notification).

This method makes several passes, each time invoking a different selector.  On the first pass, +performPosing implementations are invoked, allowing modifictions to the ObjC runtime to happen early (before +initialize).  Then, +didLoad implementations are processed.
