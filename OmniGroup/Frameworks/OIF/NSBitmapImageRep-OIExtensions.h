/* Low-efficiency methods for extracting single pixels from an NSBitmapImageRep */

- (NSColor *)colorOfPixel:(unsigned)x :(unsigned)y;

/* faster, but forces extra restrictions on image content */
- (void)getRGBA:(unsigned int *)c forPixelAtX:(unsigned)x y:(unsigned)y scaledToBPS:(int)bps;

/* Another possibility would be:
- (NSDictionary *)componentsOfPixelsForRow:(int)row colorSpaceName:(NSString *)foo scaledToBPS:(int)bps;

where the dictionary would have keys "red", "cyan", "saturation", "alpha", whatever, and values which are NSDatas containing a zillion ints, or possibly a special wrapper object which wraps array(s) of integers efficiently. This would be fast *and* not suck too much. */
