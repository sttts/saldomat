Package formats
---------------
S3cmd is distributed in two formats:
1) Prebuilt RPM file - should work on most RPM-based
   distributions
2) Source .tar.gz package



Installation of RPM package
---------------------------
As user "root" run:
   
	rpm -ivh s3cmd-X.Y.Z.noarch.rpm

where X.Y.Z is the most recent s3cmd release version.

You may be informed about missing dependencies
on Python or some libraries. Please consult your 
distribution documentation on ways to solve the problem.


Installation of source .tar.gz package
--------------------------------------
There are three options to run s3cmd from source tarball:

1) S3cmd program as distributed in s3cmd-X.Y.Z.tar.gz 
   can be run directly from where you untar'ed the package.

2) Or you may want to move "s3cmd" file and "S3" subdirectory
   to some other path. Make sure that "S3" subdirectory ends up
   in the same place where you move the "s3cmd" file. 

   For instance if you decide to move s3cmd to you $HOME/bin
   you will have $HOME/bin/s3cmd file and $HOME/bin/S3 directory 
   with a number of support files.

3) The cleanest and most recommended approach is to run

	python setup.py install

   You will however need Python "distutils" module for this to 
   work. It is often part of the core python package (e.g. in 
   OpenSuse Python 2.5 package) or it can be installed using your
   package manager, e.g. in Debian use 

	apt-get install python2.4-setuptools

   Again, consult your distribution documentation on how to 
   find out the actual package name and how to install it then.


Note to distibutions package maintainers
----------------------------------------
Define shell environment variable S3CMD_PACKAGING=yes if you
don't want setup.py to install manpages and doc files. You'll
have to install them manually in your .spec or similar package
build scripts.

On the other hand if you want setup.py to install manpages 
and docs, but to other than default path, define env 
variables $S3CMD_INSTPATH_MAN and $S3CMD_INSTPATH_DOC. Check 
out setup.py for details and default values.
